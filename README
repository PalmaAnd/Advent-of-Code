# Advent-of-Code-2022
This is my try on the Advent of Code 2022 by using Typescript.
I've never used pure Typescript to write scripts for problems like these.


# Getting started
Clone the repository

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.git <project_name>
```

## Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>

npm install
```

To compile the Typescript files and to generate the Javascript files for execution execute the following:
```
npm run build
node /dist/<name_folder>/<name_file.js>
```
